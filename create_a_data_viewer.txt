Basically if you just send

want react to do data processing for speed

so we need to get the data into react
with it in react it gets processed

*** TASK: send flask data to react to be processed and displayed dynamically ***

to get it into react need to send a large amount of data
    - not too much to slow anything down



data viewer
- exploratory tool for viewing api data
- from dropdowns select your parameters and get your data in a json
    - parameters go into the query of the api call
        - kind of just building api calls 
            - might be worth doing 
    - convert to excel etc.
